# Git Standards

Try to Push Any Time any meaningful changes to code are made at the end of a coding session (i.e. day/evening)

Pull every time before pushing to minimize potential conflicts between Git.  Try to leave 10 minutes or so at the end of a coding session to pull and handle conflicts before pushing and ending.

Prior to Merging branches, code should be commented with Javadoc comments, and there should be clear understanding of how the code is organized.
